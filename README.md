  #### Comments
  I added a line to the app, ingredients.  I was able to get the ingredients to post alongside the burger name, but had some difficulties putting the ingedients that the user inputs.  When the put works, the devour button doesn't.  I'm not sure why that is.  Deploying on Heroku was extremely confusing.
